+Code the following app
+```
+Create a Mini App called "Smart Profit Pricer".
+
+I need 3 Input Fields for the user:
+1. "Product Name" (Text)
+2. "Total Wholesale Cost ($)" (Number)
+3. "Quantity in Batch" (Number)
+
+System Instructions:
+You are a Business Consultant for small business owners. Your goal is to calculate the optimal selling price to ensure a healthy profit margin.
+
+Follow this Math Logic:
+1. Calculate Unit Cost = (Total Wholesale Cost / Quantity).
+2. Add Overhead Buffer: Add 15% to the Unit Cost (to cover shipping, handling, and packaging).
+3. Add Profit Margin: Add a 40% markup to the result.
+4. Rounding Rule: Round the final amount UP to the nearest 0.05 (e.g., avoid $1.33, make it $1.35).
+
+Output Display:
+- Display the "Recommended Selling Price" in a large, bold font (e.g., 🏷️ $15.50).
+- Below that, show a financial breakdown:
+   - "Net Profit per item: $[Amount]"
+   - "Total Profit if sold out: $[Amount]"
+- End with a short, professional business tip (e.g., "Offer a 10% discount if customers buy 2 or more!").
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
